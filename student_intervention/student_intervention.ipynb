    "\n",
    "**Overview**: <br>\n",
    "SVM classifies samples by a separating hyperplane. It is flexible with non-traditional data input, eg. string, which makes it versatile in many applications, such as, text classification, image classification, bioinformatics (protein classification, cancer classification) and hand-written character classification. The time and space complexity of SVM classifier are both O(n<sup>3</sup>) where n is the sample size<sup>[2]</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**<sup>[3,4]</sup>:<br>\n",
    "- Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "- Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "- Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "- Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n",
    "- Overfitting can be controlled by using soft margin.\n",
    "- No local minima in doing the convex optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**<sup>[3]</sup>:<br>\n",
    "- If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances.\n",
    "- SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "- Sensitive to noisy (mis-labeled) data.\n",
    "- The classification results can be very sensitive to the selection of kernel which makes the choice of kernel crucial.\n",
    "- Poor performance on multiclass classification.\n",
    "- Poor performance on highly skewed/imbalanced data sets.\n",

    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    "- Create the F<sub>1</sub> scoring function using `make_scorer` and store it in `f1_scorer`.\n",
    " - Set the `pos_label` parameter to the correct value!\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using `f1_scorer` as the scoring method, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_obj`."
